# Random Dinosaur Infographic

## How to start the page

### Prerequisite
The user doesn't need to install anything. 

### Steps
1. First, the user should put their name, height, weight and diet. 
2. Click the button 'compare Me'. As soon as the user clicks the button, A grid will appear. The grid has 9 tiles with various dinosaurs. The grid shows the names, pictures and description for dinosaurs.
3. The user can compare their information with dinosour's information. Each tile has random descriptions: info about dinosaur, compared info between the user and the dinosaur.

## Project logic 

1. To start the project, I created 'dinos' class and constructor as well as 'human' class and constructor. 
2. Using 'dino.json' file as an object file was a bit tricky, so I did 'googling' to find ideas. I managed to get ideas such as 'json.parse()...fetch' etc. 
I don't have much experiences with fetch API so I trid to use fetch API. 
3. Another difficult part was to display the data on the grid. I tried several methods and ended up facing endless error messages.
