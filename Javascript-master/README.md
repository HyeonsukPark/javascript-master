# Random Dinosaur Infographic

## How to start the page

1. First of all, the users should put their name, height, weight and diet. 
2. As soon as they click the button 'compare Me', A grid appears. The grid has 9 tiles which have a variety of dinosours. The grid shows names, pictures and explanations about 
dinosours. Also, the users can compare their information with dinosour's one. There are random facts about dinosours. 

### Project logic 

1. To start the project, I created 'dinos' class and constructor as well as 'human' class and constructor. 
2. Using 'dino.json' file as an object file was a bit tricky, so I did 'googling' to find ideas. I managed to get ideas such as 'json.parse()...fetch' etc.

3. Another difficult part was to display the data on the grid. I tried several methods and ended up facing endless error messages.
